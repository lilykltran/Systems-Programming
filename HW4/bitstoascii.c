/*This function writes characters to the stream FILE. It iterates through each index of the existing matrix
and writes with black char where there is a 1 and writes with  white char where there is a 0. The way this function checks
whether or not there is a 1 or 0 is line 18, where it right shifts the bits array by 5, which is the same thing as
dividing by 32, which is the size of each index. This first accesses the correct index the bit should be in. Then, it
uses & to check if that bit is turned on or not. If it's turned on, that means there exists a bit, and it should be written with
black char. If it's not turned on (has a 0 value), then it should be written with white char.*/
